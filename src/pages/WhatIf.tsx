          What if things go right? <br />
          What if it turns out better than you ever imagined? <br />
          What if this choice leads you somewhere kinder? <br />
          What if you feel lighter, calmer, more yourself? <br />
          What if you grow in ways you didn’t expect? <br />
          What if you look back and feel grateful that you tried? <br />
          You’ll never know unless you try. <br />
          So don’t only think about what could go wrong— think about everything <br />
          that could go right.

          Not everything needs certainty — some things just need a chance. <br />
